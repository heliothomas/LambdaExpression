New switch statements are not only more compact and readable.
They also remove the need for break statements.
The code execution will not fall through after the first match.
Another notable difference is that we can assign a switch statement directly to the variable.
It was not possible previously.
Itâ€™s also possible to execute code in switch expressions without returning any value
